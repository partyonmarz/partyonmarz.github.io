            <font size="2">I created a visual synth in Touchdesigner and collaborated with artist Charley Alexander and videographer Scotty Dittrich to create a bank of organic looking genertaive visuals for the project.  I also aided with the setup, performance and breakdown of the installation.  The Gateway was a projection mapped art installation for the Coachalla Valley Music and Arts Festival in April of 2012. The structure was designed by architect Alexis Rochas of stereo.bot and commissioned by Coachella as their highlight installation for 2012. The project lead was Bryant Place of <b>Sensory Sync</b>, lighting was designed by Simon Clark and Jeremy Roth of Stageworks, and Dave Taylor of Senovva handled projector blending and setup.</font>
