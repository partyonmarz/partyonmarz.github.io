            <font size="2">I was contracted by Fresh AV to work collaboratively on a special project for Redwood City.  The Hometown Holiday event was approaching and the city wanted to do something interactive for the event.  The Fresh AV team proposed creating large scale touchscreens for an interactive coloring/drawing experience that would make the event unique.  I developed and implemented the Touchdesigner software that runs the touchscreens.  I also built the custom computer server that runs all three of the large scale touchscreens off of one PC machine.  It has the ability to create 10 points of touch contact and users can save the drawings they like which Fresh AV posted to the web for users to find after the event.  You could also select different scenes which included some winter scenes as well as blueprints of the cities most popular buildings.</font>
